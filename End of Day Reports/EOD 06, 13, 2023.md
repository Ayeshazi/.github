# Team Dragon
As a team, we made significant progress in various areas. We collaborated on GitHub, creating milestones and issues for the Dragons team that were approved by our TPM (Technical Program Manager), ensuring efficient project management. Our Staff sheet was regularly updated with the names and data of new interns, facilitating effective communication and collaboration. To further our recruitment efforts, we scheduled additional interviews and successfully achieved our goal of securing 50 interns. Seamless onboarding was ensured by promptly sending internship offer letters to the newly selected interns. Conducting interviews allowed us to assess candidates thoroughly. Incentivizing employee referrals, we implemented a referral bonus list to encourage team members to refer qualified candidates. Creating a comprehensive staff list, including contractual details, we enhanced coordination and planning by sharing it with the Thunder team. Together with our HR staff, we explored innovative strategies to attract more interns. We also provided comprehensive training to our new HR member, who joined us on Monday, ensuring their preparedness for recruitment endeavors. Additionally, we created issues on GitHub under the approved milestone, as guided by our TPM, allowing us to track and address project tasks effectively. Collectively, our efforts contributed to driving recruitment and HR functions, optimizing team performance, and ensuring the success of our internship program.
