# Team Basher
 **KVM Overview:** We conducted a comprehensive session on KVMs (Kernel-based Virtual Machines). I introduced the entire team to their functionality and explained how we are utilizing them for the Matty project. This allowed everyone to gain a better understanding of KVMs and their role in our project.
**SILK Guide Project**: In addition to our work on the Matty project, we also started making changes to the issue on the SILK Guide repository. This is an important step in the website's development, as it brings us closer to the final version.
**App Development Project:** We conducted a productive brainstorming session for an upcoming app development project. Furthermore, we prepared for tomorrow's call with Microsoft regarding the app development project. As part of our preparations, we gathered relevant information and conducted thorough research to formulate insightful questions to ask the Microsoft tech team.
