Problems:
1. Did not follow the actual process of what was asked of them:
 - Make a Milestone
 - Get Milestone Approved
 - Make Issues
 - Get Issues Approved
 - THEN start working on Issues.

2. Instead they were doing random work. 
3. The use of "I" instead of "We" as a team effort to work on problems especially that they have 5 members per team.


If they aren't management material, and just be a contributor then they should be intelligent enough to:

 - Use Milestones
 - Get Milestone Approvals from their boss
 - Use Issues
 - Get Issue Approvals from boss
 - Assign their staff to the appropriate issues
 - Get Approval of Staff Assignments
 - Outline Sprints
 - Run SCRUM Meetings
 - Motivate their Teammates
